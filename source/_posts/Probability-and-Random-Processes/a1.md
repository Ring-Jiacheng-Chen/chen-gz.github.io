*The Sample Space*

**outcome** or **sample point**

We define an outcome or sample point of a ran-
dom experiment as a result that cannot be decomposed into other results. When we perform a random experiment, one and only one outcome occurs. 

The *sample space* S of a random experiment is defined as the set of all possible outcomes.

We call S a *discrete sample* space if S is *countable*; that is, its outcomes can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers. 

We call S a continuous sample space if S is not *countable*.

*Events*

Events correspond to susbsets of S(sample space).

correspond to subsets of S.Two events of special interest are the certain event, S, which consists of all outcomes and hence always occurs, and the impossible or null event, $\emptyset$, which contains no outcomes and hence never occurs.

An event from a discrete sample space that consists of a single outcome is called an *elementary event*.
