## preface 

In the past hundred years, people thing number theory is the queen of math(math is the queen of science).  we find it very interesting.  In the number theory we can find many many amazing things.  The conclusion is very short and very very beautify.  But almost all of them are very hard to prove.  This is very interesting things in the nature. 

Number theory is from integers. When we talk about number theory, always focus on positive not negative.  We can find that first amazing thing of number theory is we only have integers. the most beautiful and easily thing in the world.      

In this passage will introduce some interest and basic information about number theory.  I hope first passage of number theory is attractive and easy to read. 

## prime number 

prime number A **prime number** (or a **prime**) is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers[from wikipedia].   

Such as 2,3,5,7,11,13,17 is prime number.  Almost all problem of number theory is about prime number.

Goldbach conjecture and most famous unsolved problem. We call............... twin prime like 3,5 or 11,13.

We wander to know if the prime is very large, does there exist twin prime and the frequency of twin number. 

there all very interesting things.
